### Subgraphs

All currently used subgraphs live on the graph protocol's centralized host. 

- [Testing Subgraph](https://graph.node.bean.money/subgraphs/name/beanstalk-testing)
  - Used during local development for debugging and rapid iteration.   
- [Dev Subgraph](https://graph.node.bean.money/subgraphs/name/beanstalk-dev)
  - Used for testing fixes or improvements made in the testing subgraph. 
- [Canonical Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/R9rnzRuiyDybfDsZfoM7eA9w8WuHtZKbroGrgWwDw1d?view=Overview)
  - Decentralized deployment to the Graph network.
  - Stable deployment and current source of truth for UI and other production processes. 
  - The `master` branch is updated when a new deployment is ready to be indexed.
  - All changes pushed to the canonical subgraph are prototyped on the testing subgraph, tested on the dev subgraph, then made canonical once verified.
