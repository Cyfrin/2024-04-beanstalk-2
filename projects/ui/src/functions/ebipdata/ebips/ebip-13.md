Per the process outlined in the [BCM Emergency Response Procedures](https://docs.bean.money/almanac/governance/beanstalk/bcm-process#emergency-response-procedures), the BCM can take swift action to protect Beanstalk in the event of a bug or security vulnerability.

In the case of EBIP-13, functionality that was removed in EBIP-12 is reintroduced this EBIP.

## Problem

The `convert` function was removed in EBIP-12.

## Solution

Add `require` statements in `LibWellConvert` that verify that the Well being Converted in is whitelisted.

Add a `require` statement in `ConvertFacet` that verifies that the token amount being Converted from is greater than 0.

Re-add the `convert` function to Beanstalk.
