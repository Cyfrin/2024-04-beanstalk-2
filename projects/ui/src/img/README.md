Naming notes:
- "logo"    = official image for a token or recognized service.
- "icon"    = everything else icon-like, including interface icons and non-token Beanstalk icons (like Pods)
- "tokens"  = erc-20, erc-1155, etc. 
- Scheme: `[name]-[type]-[variant?]`, examples: `pod-icon`, `dune-logo-winter`.
